function plot2dd(X)% modified plot2d  - Two dimensional plot.% X is a matrix with 2 rows and any number of columns.% plot2d(X) plots these columns as points in the plane% and connects them, in order, with lines.% The scale is set to [-20, 20] in both directions.%% For example, the statement X=house creates % a sample matrix X representing common figures.% Then, for various 2 by 2 matrices A,%    plot2d(A*X)% demonstrates the effect of multiplication by A.x = X(1,:)';y = X(2,:)';plot(x, y, 'ro', x, y, 'g');
